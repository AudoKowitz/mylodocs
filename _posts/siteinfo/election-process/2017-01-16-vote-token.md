A special VOTE token is used to conduct the voting for Komodo’s Notary Node election.

For each annual election, a new VOTE token is generated and airdropped at a 1:1 ratio to allKMD holders. VOTE tokens from previous years’ elections cannot be used.

The tokens can be accessed with the same seed phrase or private key (WIF) for the address in which you store your KMD coins.

The easiest way to access your VOTE tokens is to store your KMD in Agama Lite Mode prior to the snapshot on April 14, 2019. Of course, you may then move your funds to any address you wish. The VOTE tokens will still be airdropped to the address in which your KMD was held at the time of the snapshot.

For those who store their KMD in Agama in Native Mode, the easiest way to access VOTE tokens is to export the private key in WIF (wallet import format). Then simply enter the WIF as the passphrase for Agama Lite Mode and activate the VOTE token.

KMD holders who store their funds on a hardware wallet, such as a Trezor or Ledger device, will need to export their private key in wallet import format (WIF) and import that key to Agama wallet in order to access their VOTE tokens and cast their ballot.

Please note that users who store their KMD on an exchange will not receive VOTE coins. Storing your assets on an exchange makes it impossible to hold your own private keys, and thus impossible to receive any coin or token from an airdrop, including VOTE tokens.
