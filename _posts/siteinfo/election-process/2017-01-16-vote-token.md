On the Komodo notary node elections voting is done with VOTE tokens.

For each elections a new VOTE token is generated and airdropped to the KMD holders. The airdrop is done with 1:1 ratio. VOTE tokens of the previous years cannot be used.

The tokens can be accessed with the same seed as with the KMD coins.

by far the easiest way to get the VOTE token is to store your KMD in Agama lite-mode prior to the snapshot. The user will be able to use the same passphrase from their KMD to login with VOTE lite mode. If KMD is stored in native mode, where the user downloads the entire blockchain, the simplest way then would be to use the WIF as the lite-mode passphrase.

To receive VOTE coins you cannot keep your KMD balance on an exchange!

For more information about voting, see the voting guide (coming soon).
