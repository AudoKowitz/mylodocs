Assetchains are a Runtime fork of Komodo.

A runtime fork means that the source code of the executable binary remains same, but it can enable a [variety of optional, customisable parameters](https://komodoplatform.com/new-assetchain-parameters/) on launch, creating an independent blockchain right out of the box.

* It does not require running the Komodo blockchain.
* It does not issue a token on upon the Komodo blockchain (like Ethereum tokens), meaning no risks from ecosystem scaling (e.g. cryptokitties).
* It does not require sending KMD coins to keep it running (unless using DPoW).
* It doesn’t require any of the limitations that most other blockchain platforms enforce on the token holders, offering absolute freedom to govern and develop your own blockchain project without constraints.
* With Assetchains, dPoW security integration support comes built-in by default, though activating it is optional. All it takes is applying to Komodo to be added to the Notary Node network, along with a nominal payment (partially in KMD, partially in the assetchains’ native token) to cover the costs of notarization transactions.
